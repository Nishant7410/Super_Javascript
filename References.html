    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
      const captain=person;
      captain.number=12;
      console.log(person);

      const wes = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
          social:{
              twitter:"hdhdss",
              facebook:"kdhfh"
          }
    };
      const cap1=Object.assign({},wes);
      const cap2=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
